              As the articles contained in this issue of Radical Philosophy indicate, ‘social reproduction’ is today more than
      ever at the centre of feminist debates. Yet the same
      articles also express a legitimate concern that recent
      theorisations obfuscate the political significance of this
      concept and its ability to describe the changes that have
      taken place in the production of labour-power in the
      present phase of capitalist development.

              In the notes that follow, I summarise the key issues
      emerging from this dossier, and then sketch a tentat-
      ive program of analysis and action that I think is made
      necessary by the crisis of reproduction that women are
      experiencing worldwide. First, however, I would like to
      briefly comment on the history of the concept, to dispose
      of the assumption that to speak of ‘social reproduction’ is
      by itself to take a radical stance. This may seem a minor
      point in the context of the present debates, but I think it
      is worth emphasising that the idea of social reproduction
      originated in the context of bourgeois economics to in-
      dicate the processes by which a social system reproduces
      itself. This is how ‘social reproduction’ was first concep-
      tualised by the François Quesnay (1694–1774) and other
      Enlightenment-era Physiocrats who, according to Marx,
      were the first economists of capitalist society, and also
      the first theorists to identify the nature of productive
      labour with agricultural work
            </p>
            <p>
              Contrary to an assumption that runs through recent
      works on social reproduction, to look at social reality
      from this viewpoint is not itself to take a Marxist or a rad-
      ical stand generally speaking. Social reproduction theor-
      ists have included a wide range of promoters of capitalist
      development. Thus, as an analytic category ‘social re-
      production’ cannot be adopted as a form of a political
      identification, as it is done by feminists describing them-
      selves as ‘social reproduction theorists’.

              What made the discussion of social reproduction by
      wages for housework theorists and activists in the 1970s
      ‘revolutionary’ (in my view) was not the field that they ex-
      amined, but what they discovered, which is the existence
      of a large area of exploitation until then unrecognised by
      all revolutionary theorists, Marxist and anarchist alike.
      It was discovering that unpaid labour is not extracted
      by the capitalist class only from the waged workday, but
      that it is also extracted from the workday of millions of
      unwaged house-workers as well as many other unpaid
      and un-free labourers. It was redefining the capitalist
      function of the wage as a creator of labour hierarchies,
      and an instrument serving to naturalise exploitative so-
      cial relations and to delegate to wage-workers power
      over the unwaged. It was unmasking the socio-economic
      function of the creation of a fictional private sphere, and
      thereby re-politicising family life, sexuality, procreation.
